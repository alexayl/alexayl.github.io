## Background

An oppportunity to work at one of my dream companies was supposed to begin in six weeks. The final interview was two weeks ago, and finally the email came in.

> Hi Alexander,
>
> Thank you for taking the time to discuss an opportunity at ____. Unfortunately, we are unable to move on with you application at this time...

After a round of interviews I thought I nailed, and dropped everything (yes, including some school work ðŸ¥´), I was rejected.

That stung. But looking back, it was kind of fun. The weeks leading up to the interviews was the most locked in I've ever been! Even though I didn't get the job, and as stupid/corny/clichÃ© this sounds, I was happy to have gone through it.

## The Vision

I wanted more chances to feel that sense of focus again. And eventually, to win. After some reflection, the answer was obvious: **projects**. Not the half-finished kind that sit in a GitHub graveyard, but real, collaborative, well-scoped projects that mimic how teams work in industry.

I began talking with other ECE friends interested in embedded systems, and they shared a similar insight. They wanted to start personal projects too, but didn't know where to start. Which microcontroller/language/software platform/peripherals to use? What tools? Embedded systems is such a broad field that analysis paralysis kicks in fast.

Thatâ€™s when it clicked: we should start a club. A dedicated space for embedded systems projects, where the framework of working with others would create natural structure and accountability.

Nothing like that existed yet. There were project-specific clubs like Electric Racing, and domain-specific ones like Purdue Machine Learning, but none that focused on embedded systems as a platform.

I imagined a launchpad to help ECE students level up: build cool things, learn what class doesnâ€™t teach, and develop professionally. Weâ€™d focus on three core areas:

1. Projects
2. Learning (practical skills industry assumes you know)
3. Professional development

Basically, everything I wish I had before that last interview.

So in January 2025, I gathered a few friends and led a brainstorm. Over a few hours we hashed out the clubâ€™s mission, drafted a rough structure, and elected initial officers. By the end, we had a name: **Embedded Systems @ Purdue**. I was voted in as **President**.

## Building from the ground up

Early on, the executive team met weekly to draft a constitution, reach out to potential faculty advisors, and plan our first slate of projects.

Ironically, despite trying to eliminate analysis paralysis, our meetings were full of it. Making group decisions was tough. Everyone had strong opinions and good ideas, which made it hard to move forward.

Eventually, we found a great advisor: the professor of our favorite class, *Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing*. We scoped out three small, flashy, low-budget projects to complete in a semester. These would serve as proof of concept and help us attract funding and members in the fall.

I made the tough call not to join a project team this semester. It felt backwards, since that was the whole reason I started the club. But with so much administrative work on my plateâ€”planning, coordinating, leading meetings, doing paperworkâ€”it wouldnâ€™t have been sustainable.

## Results!

Despite the chaotic start, we made real progress.

We held a callout meeting and grew to 14 active members. All three projects made it to our schoolâ€™s tech showcase, and one even placed second, winning a cash prize. Our Discord server grew to over 100 people thanks to the visibility.

On the administrative side, I built a website, designed our logo, secured a small amount of funding, connected with other club leaders, and started building relationships with industry contacts.

## Challenges

We faced plenty of challenges, and there are a few things Iâ€™d absolutely do differently.

First, getting officially recognized as a student org took forever. We spent weeks drafting a constitution, securing a faculty advisor, completing university trainings, and finally submitting our application. After that, the approval process took even longer. We couldnâ€™t open a bank account until everything was finalized, which delayed everything else.

Speaking of the bank account... it was looking pretty empty. Since most funding options werenâ€™t available until fall, we introduced dues to stay afloat. Not ideal, but necessary. If I had to do it again, Iâ€™d prioritize fundraising way earlier. Lack of funding was our biggest blocker when it came to actually completing projects.

Another lesson: administrative work scales fast. I ended up handling most of the external communication, internal logistics, graphics, the website, and any loose ends no one else picked up. I sent dozens of emails, taught myself some design tools, and ran a butt load of meetings. I donâ€™t regret any of it, but I definitely didnâ€™t expect how much time it would take.

## Looking to the Fall

After a whirlwind first semester, weâ€™re setting our sights higher for Fall 2025. Our goals:

- Recruit 50+ active members
- Launch more technically challenging and better-structured projects
- Host four hands-on workshops
- Design and distribute club merch

And most importantly, Iâ€™ll finally be joining a project team; getting back to the kind of work that inspired all of this in the first place.
